# Agriculture Data Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze agricultural data spanning multiple years to derive insights about crop production, yields, and cultivation areas. The data is processed to create two tables showcasing maximum and minimum crop productions per year (**Table 1**) and average yields and cultivation areas for each crop between 1950-2020 (**Table 2**).
